190Tell me about your recent project.
 Currently I am working on a project building a platform for an e-commerce company using
 Terraform, I am building ECS to orchestrate docker containers stored in ECR. We are using
 Jenkins for our CICD, we have Jenkinsfile that runs our pipelines.
 What is Continuous Integration?
 It is development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository
 frequently. It can range from a couple of changes every day or a week to a couple of
 changes in one hour in larger scales.
 Each piece of code (change/patch) is verified, to make sure the change is safe to
 merge. Today, it's a common practice to test the change using an automated build
 that makes sure the code can be integrated. It can be one build which runs several
 tests in different levels (unit, functional, etc.) or several separate builds that all or
 some has to pass in order for the change to be merged into the repository.
 What is Continuous Deployment?
 A development strategy used by developers to release software automatically into
 production where any code commit must pass through an automated testing phase.
 Only when this is successful is the release considered production worthy. This
 eliminates any human interaction and should be implemented only after
 production-ready pipelines have been set with real-time monitoring and reporting of
 deployed assets. If any issues are detected in production it should be easy to
 rollback to previous working state.
 What is AWS Fargate?
 Amazon definition: "AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that
 works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic
 Kubernetes Service (EKS).”
 What is Amazon ECR?
 Amazon definition: "Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed
 Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and
 deploy Docker container images."
 What is Amazon ECS?
 Amazon definition: "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully
 managed container orchestration service. Customers such as Duolingo, Samsung,
 GE, and Cook Pad use ECS to run their most sensitive and mission critical
 applications because of its security, reliability, and scalability."
What’s DNS?
 A DNS service such as Amazon Route 53 is a globally distributed service that translates human
 readable names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that
 computers use to connect to each other. The Internet’s DNS system works much like a phone
 book by managing the mapping between names and numbers. DNS servers translate requests
 for names into IP addresses, controlling which server an end user will reach when they type a
 domain name into their web browser. These requests are called queries.
 Types of DNS Service:
 Authoritative DNS: An authoritative DNS service provides an update mechanism that
 developers use to manage their public DNS names.
 Recursive DNS: Clients typically do not make queries directly to authoritative DNS services.
 Instead, they generally connect to another type of DNS service known a resolver, or a recursive
 DNS service.
 What is TLS vs SSL?
 SSL refers to Secure Sockets Layer whereas TLS refers to Transport Layer Security.
 Basically, they are one and the same, but, entirely different. How similar both are?
 SSL and TLS are cryptographic protocols that authenticate data transfer between
 servers, systems, applications and users.
 Does TLS mean HTTPS?
 In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or,
 formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over
 TLS, or HTTP over SSL.
 What is a Route?
 A route is exposing a service by giving it hostname which is externally reachable
 What is AWS CloudTrail?
 AWS definition: "AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance,
 operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account."
 What is AWS CloudWatch?
 AWS definition: "Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service..."
 What is Route 53?
 "Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System
 (DNS) web service..." Some of Route 53 features:
● Register domain
 ● DNS service - domain name translations
 ● Health checks - verify your app is available
 What is AWS ACM?
 Amazon definition: "AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily
 provision, manage, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport
 Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and your internal
 connected resources."
 What is blue green deployment?
 Blue/Green deployments are a form of progressive delivery where a new version of
 the application is deployed while the old version still exists. The two versions coexist
 for a brief period of time while user traffic is routed to the new version, before the old
 version is discarded (if all goes well).
 What is Canary deployment vs blue Green?
 Canary deployment works similarly to blue-green deployment, but uses a
 slightly different method. Instead of another full environment waiting to be
 switched over once deployment is finished, canary deployments cut over
 just a small subset of servers or nodes first, before finishing the others.
 Terraform.
 What terraform.tfstate file is used for?
 It keeps track of the IDs of created resources so that Terraform knows what it's
 managing.
 What is Terraform import?
 Terraform import is used to import existing infrastucture. It allows you to bring
 resources created by some other means (eg. manually launched cloud resources)
 and bring it under Terraform management.
 Explain "State Locking"
State locking is a mechanism that blocks an operations against a specific state file
 from multiple callers so as to avoid conflicting operations from different team
 members. Once the first caller's operation's lock is released the other team member
 may go ahead to carry out his own operation. Nevertheless Terraform will first check
 the state file to see if the desired resource already exist and if not it goes ahead to
 create it.
 Explain Terraform Modules
 A Terraform module is a set of Terraform configuration files in a single directory.
 Modules are small, reusable Terraform configurations that let you manage a group
 of related resources as if they were a single resource. Even a simple configuration
 consisting of a single directory with one or more .tf files is a module. When you run
 Terraform commands directly from such a directory, it is considered the root
 module. So in this sense, every Terraform configuration is part of a module.
 What are " Terraform Provisioners"? What they are used for?
 Provisioners used to execute actions on local or remote machine. It's extremely
 useful in case you provisioned an instance and you want to make a couple of
 changes in the machine you've created without manually ssh into it after Terraform
 f
 inished to run and manually run them.
 What is a "tainted resource"?
 It's a resource which was successfully created but failed during provisioning.
 Terraform will fail and mark this resource as "tainted".
 What are Input Variables in Terraform? Why one should use them?
 Input variables serve as parameters to the module in Terraform. They allow you for
 example to define once the value of a variable and use that variable in different
 places in the module so next time you would want to change the value, you will
 change it in one place instead of changing the value in different places in the
 module.
 Explain what is a "provider".
 "Terraform relies on plugins called "providers" to interact with cloud providers, SaaS
 providers, and other APIs...Each provider adds a set of resource types and/or data
 sources that Terraform can manage. Every resource type is implemented by a
 provider; without providers, Terraform can't manage any kind of infrastructure."
 Docker.
 What is Dockerfile?
Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.
 A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on
 the command line to assemble an image.
 What is the difference between ADD and COPY in Dockerfile?
 COPY takes in a src and destination. It only lets you copy in a local file or directory
 from your host (the machine building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.
 ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. First, you can use a
 URL instead of a local file / directory. Secondly, you can extract a tar file from the
 source directly into the destination. Although ADD and COPY are functionally
 similar, generally speaking, COPY is preferred. That’s because it’s more transparent
 than ADD. COPY only supports the basic copying of local files into the container,
 while ADD has some features (like local-only tar extraction and remote URL support)
 that are not immediately obvious.
 What is the difference between CMD and RUN in Dockerfile?
 RUN lets you execute commands inside of your Docker image. These commands
 get executed once at build time and get written into your Docker image as a new
 layer. CMD is the command the container executes by default when you launch the
 built image. A Dockerfile can only have one CMD. You could say that CMD is a
 Docker run-time operation, meaning it’s not something that gets executed at build
 time. It happens when you run an image. A running image is called a container.
 What’s the meaning of FROM on a Dockerfile?
 “From” command on a dockerfile is used to get the base image for the docker file. Example
 of a base ubuntu, alpine ect
 What is Docker Hub?
 This is used to store Docker images
 How are containers different from virtual machines (VMs)?
 The primary difference between containers and VMs is that containers allow you to
 virtualize multiple workloads on the operating system while in the case of VMs the
 hardware is being virtualized to run multiple machines each with its own OS. You
 can also think about it as containers are for OS-level virtualization while VMs are for
 hardware virtualization.
 ● Containers don't require an entire guest operating system as VMs.
 Containers share the system's kernel as opposed to VMs. They isolate
 themselves via the use of namespaces and cgroups
● It usually takes a few seconds to set up a container as opposed to VMs
 which can take minutes or at least more time than containers as there is an
 entire OS to boot and initialize as opposed to containers which has share of
 the underlying OS
 ● Virtual machines considered to be more secured than containers
 How do you run a container?
 docker run
 What is IAM?
 AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely
 control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in)
 and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.
 What are some of the features of IAM?
 Features:
 1. Shared access to your AWS account
 2. Granular permissions
 3. Secure access to AWS resources for applications that run on Amazon EC2
 4. Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
 5. Identity federation
 6. Identity information for assurance
 7. PCI DSS Compliance
 8. Integrated with many AWS services
 9. Eventually Consistent
 A user is unable to access an s3 bucket. What might be the problem?
 The problem might be:
 1. That the IAM permissions boundaries does not allow access to the S3 bucket
 2. That the bucket's Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings is not allowing them to
 access
 3. It can also be user credentials issue
 4. that the Amazon VPC endpoint policy does not includes the correct permissions to
 access your S3 buckets and objects
 5.
 What are Security Groups?
 A security group acts as a virtual firewall, controlling the traffic that is allowed to
 reach and leave the resources that it is associated with. For example, after you
 associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound and
 outbound traffic for the instance.
 Explain stateless vs. stateful?
 Stateful: This means any changes applied to an incoming rule will be automatically applied to
 the outgoing rule. Example: If you allow an incoming port 80, the outgoing port 80 will be
 automatically opened. Stateless: This means any changes applied to an incoming rule will not
 be applied to the outgoing rule.
What is EBS?
 Amazon Elastic Block Store provides raw block-level storage that can be attached to Amazon
 EC2 instances and is used by Amazon Relational Database Service. It is one of the two
 block-storage options offered by AWS, with the other being the EC2 Instance Store
 How to migrate an instance to another availability zone?
 It's not possible to move an existing instance to another subnet, Availability Zone, or VPC.
 Instead, you can manually migrate the instance by creating a new Amazon Machine Image
 (AMI) from the source instance. Then, launch a new instance using the new AMI in the
 desired subnet, Availability Zone, or VPC
 What can you attach to an EC2 instance in order to store data?
 EBS is block store which is separately attached to EC2 to store data
 What is Amazon ECS?
 Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable and fast container
 management service. You can use it to run, stop, and manage containers on a cluster. With
 Amazon ECS, your containers are defined in a task definition that you use to run an
 individual task or task within a service
 Explain what is AWS S3?
 Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers
 industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all
 sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of
 use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile apps etc
 What is s3 bucket?
 A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. You can store any number of objects
 in a bucket and can have up to 100 buckets in your account.
 What is a storage class?
 S3 storage classes are purpose-built to provide the lowest cost storage for different access
 patterns. S3 storage classes are ideal for virtually any use case, including those with
 demanding performance needs, data residency requirements, unknown or changing access
 patterns, or archival storage.
 What storage classes are there in S3?
 1. S3 Standard (S3 Standard)
 2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering)
 3. Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
 4. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
 5. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
 6. Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Formerly S3 Glacier)
 Explain what is CloudFront?
 Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and
 dynamic web content, such as . html, . css, . js, and image files, to your users.
CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called
 edge locations.
 What is "infrastructure as code"?
 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code
 instead of through manual processes. With IaC, configuration files are created that contain
 your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations.
 What implementation of IAC are you familiar with?
 Terraform
 What benefits infrastructure-as-code has?
 1. Cost reduction
 2. Speed
 3. Reduced risk
 4. Test
 5. Stable and scalable environments
 6. Accountability
 7. Configuration consistency
 8. Documentation
 9. Enhanced security
 What is ELB (Elastic Load Balancing)?
 Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across
 multiple targets and virtual appliances in one or more Availability Zones (AZs).
 What are the different source for AMIs?
 1. from amazon
 2. your own
 3. community
 What is the shared responsibility model?
 A shared responsibility model is a cloud security framework that dictates the security
 obligations of a cloud computing provider and its users to ensure accountability.
 What AWS is responsible for and what the user is responsible for based on the shared
 responsibility model?
 AWS responsibility “Security of the Cloud” - AWS is responsible for protecting the
 infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is
 composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.
 Customer responsibility “Security in the Cloud” – Customer responsibility will be determined
 by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects. This determines the amount of
 configuration work the customer must perform as part of their security responsibilities.
 What is AWS Artifact?
 AWS Artifact is your go-to, central resource for compliance-related information that
